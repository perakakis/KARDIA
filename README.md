# KARDIA
KARDIA (“heart” in Greek) is a Matlab software developed for the analysis of cardiac interbeat interval data. Available functions are called through a graphical user interface and permit the analysis of phasic cardiac responses elicited by environmental stimuli, and the estimation of several common time and frequency domain heart rate variability parameters. Scaling exponents of heartbeat fluctuations are calculated with the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) algorithm. Grand average and individual subject results can be exported to spreadsheets for further statistical analysis. KARDIA is distributed free of charge under the terms of GNU public license.

KARDIA is intended to be a useful tool for researchers with no specific programming skills and therefore all functionalities are directly available from an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI).

Phasic Cardiac Responses (PCRs) time-locked to specific events may be calculated using either weighted averages or a range of interpolation meth- ods. Common time and frequency domain HRV statistics are also estimated. The power spectrum is calculated using either fast Fourier transform or parametric methods, and scaling exponents of IBI fluctuations are computed using DFA. Individual subject results and grand average statistics can also be exported to Excel spreadsheets for further statistical analysis.

KARDIA was entirely written in Matlab scripting language. All functions are contained within a single m-file (kardia.m), although the complete software package includes the software logo, a matrix with GUI-related information, documentation and sample data stored in different subfolders.
